WIP project, a cheap usb barcode scanner that reads barcode and adds up the prices of the products
the paticular code will work with a usb scanner that reads the barcode and returns it with an "enter" key 
(so i know when it is done reading the barcode)
i am working for an updated code for a faster reader, but i need to find a way of knowing when the read has ended, no interrups
